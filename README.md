### What am I going to do?

You're about to create the most simple calculator in three different languages.
The calculator will consist on the next operations.

* Sum between two numbers (a + b)
* Sum all the numbers in a list ([1,2,3] = 6)
* Substract two numbers (a - b)
* Substract to the first element of the list, the remaining ones ([5,2,1] = 5 - 2 - 1 = 2)
* Product of two numbers (a * b)
* Division between two numbers (a / b)

The user will use the command line to introduce the values desired by the calculator.
The calculator must be done in the three languages.

At the end of the exercise, create a pull request.

Happy coding!
